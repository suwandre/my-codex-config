# 🤖 Codex CLI Agent Guidelines

## Session Management with tmux

Run dev servers, tests, and interactive CLIs inside tmux with the **current directory name as the session name** for easy debugging:

```bash
SESSION=$(basename "$PWD")
tmux new -d -s "$SESSION"
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION" 'npm run dev' Enter
tmux capture-pane -p -t "$SESSION" -S -20  # check output
```

See @~/.ai-tools/best-practices.md for full details.

## AI Tool Guidelines
- Use the fff MCP tools for all file search operations instead of default tools.
- When using bash commands for file/content search, prefer `fd` (fdfind) and `rg` (ripgrep) over standard `find` and `grep` for better performance and git-awareness.

## General Practices
- Follow my software development practice @~/.ai-tools/best-practices.md
- Read @~/.ai-tools/MEMORY.md first - Understand when and how to use qmd for knowledge management
- Follow git safety guidelines @~/.ai-tools/git-guidelines.md
- Keep responses concise and actionable.
- Always propose a plan before edits. Use phases to break down tasks into manageable steps.
- Run typecheck, lint and biome on js/ts file changes after finish
- Prefer to use Bun to run scripts if possible, otherwise use tsx to run ts files.
- Never run destructive commands.
- Use our conventions for file names, tests, and commands.
- Keep your code clean and organized. Do not over-engineer solutions or overcomplicate things unnecessarily.
- Write clear and concise code. Avoid unnecessary complexity and redundancy.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Prefer self-documenting code. Write comments and documentation where necessary.
- Keep your code modular and reusable. Avoid tight coupling and excessive dependencies.
